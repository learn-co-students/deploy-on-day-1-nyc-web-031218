Short Bio: Hi everyone! I'm here to balance my left and right brain. They're always fighting! I studied genetical engineering in undergrad and grew weird mutant plants. After graduating, I became a professional musician for the past three years and have been living in NYC. I also organize a small concert series, and my bro runs a cool hackathon league called Major League Hacking. Coding seems like a good way to be creative and scientific at the same time. I'm also eager to find someone to play ping pong with me! Grew up in Nyack NY.
